          <p>Great Falls Park is more than just a scenic wonder—its history is deeply intertwined with the development of commerce, transportation, and conservation in Virginia. Spanning over 800 acres, the park preserves the beauty of the Potomac River while showcasing remnants of America’s early industrial growth.</p>

          <h2>Early Native American Presence</h2>
          <p>Long before European settlers arrived, Native American tribes, including the Powhatan Confederacy, lived along the Potomac River. They relied on the river’s resources for fishing, hunting, and transportation. Archaeological evidence suggests that Indigenous people inhabited the region for thousands of years, leaving behind stone tools and artifacts that hint at their way of life.</p>
          
          <h2> The Industrial Era & The Patowmack Canal</h2>
          <p>In the late 18th century, the area became a focal point for economic growth when George Washington envisioned a canal system to improve transportation along the Potomac. The result was the Patowmack Canal, one of the first canal systems in the U.S., built between 1785 and 1802.</p>
          <h4>Key Facts About the Patowmack Canal:</h4>
          <p>1.Designed to bypass the dangerous rapids of Great Falls</p>
          <p>2.Built using enslaved labor and hired European engineers</p>
          <p>3.Operated from 1802 to 1830 but was abandoned due to high costs</p>
          <p>Although it was eventually replaced by the Chesapeake & Ohio Canal, remnants of Washington’s vision remain visible today. Visitors can explore the canal ruins and learn about its role in early American trade.</p>
            <h2>Great Falls Becomes a National Park</h2>
            <p>As the region transitioned from industry to recreation, efforts to preserve its natural beauty began. In 1930, the federal government acquired the land, and in 1966, Great Falls Park was officially designated as a National Park under the National Park Service (NPS).</p>
            <p>Since then, the park has been a beloved destination for hiking, picnicking, wildlife observation, and history tours, offering visitors a glimpse into both the past and present of Virginia’s natural landscape.</p>
