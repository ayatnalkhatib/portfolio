          <h2>Park Pass Options:</h2>
          <p>Great Falls Park has been a vital part of the area's history for centuries. The park is home to the remains of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, a key transportation route built in the 1800s. The park was established to preserve the beauty and history of the area and became a National Park in 1966. You can explore the historical Lockhouse 10 or learn about the canal's role in shaping the region at the park's Visitor Center.</p>
